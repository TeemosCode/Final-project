# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Help user's simulate total time it takes to finish a project based on individual tasks inputs.

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:
Does the user's initial conjecture of total duration of the project land within 95% Confidence Interval of the simulation.

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). 
For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?  
Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
It depends on the user's input and the distribution of their choice the program provides. (PERT, Normal & Uniform)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
Iput the variable names, best case, worst case and choose the distribution model for each variable.
